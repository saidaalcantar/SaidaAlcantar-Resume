        <p class="lead mb-4">A perfect example of leadership was during a water polo game. During one of the quarters, the entirety of the JV players replaced the Varsity level players. Since our JV players were fairly new to the game, I needed to lead them through the game as the group's goalie. As a goalie, I gave enthusiastic help, along with blocking, and passing. But more importantly, I consistently guided my teammates‚Äô through the game. As an example, I call out ‚Äúdown‚Äù letting my teammates know that the ball is in our favor, directing our wing player to go out and receive a pass from our point and shoot. In order to win the match, I needed to communicate, guide and motivate them. Prior to the game, we had a motivational speech and outlined the game strategy. It was here that I gave the newcomers a chance to voice inquiries or concerns and offered general guidance. During the game, I utilized accommodating game terms like "dump" to tell a player with the ball that there are five seconds left to dump the ball away from our goal and "clear" to tell my teammates to clear the center for a drive. I assisted the players that were open for a pass, and guided that pass to an open area. There was an abrupt startling time during the game when the rival team had caught up to us. This made us all impatient and unmotivated since we were afraid of losing. As a team goalie and designated leader, I motivated them, kept their spirits up and urged them all to complete our game strong by cheering them up and keeping positivity. To switch up the general state of mind, we made a few alterations, changed players' positions and had an overall adjustment in strategy. After their persistent effort on the field, I acknowledged the team‚Äôs performance and took a win as a team.As a first generation college student, I didn't receive enough guidance in regards to academics  nor proper preparation for college. Not long ago, I was able to take advantage of many educational opportunities provided by my school, one of them being the Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP). Even though I've only recently joined, I have learned a great amount during this limited time. I was unable to meet directly with the program coordinators due to Coronavirus but regardless of our restrictions, it didn't prevent me from learning more about the college preparation process. The program was generous enough to have weekly webinars where we went over an assortment of significant subjects: timelines, college application processes, choosing the right major, monetary assets like grants, scholarships, and FAFSA. As any excessively energized high school senior would concur, I experienced  great difficulty in picking a major and did not know how to begin my research to choose one. I am thankful that I was able to discover information about my major options with my program coordinators.  My coordinators could guide me towards a better direction.<br><br>
